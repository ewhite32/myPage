  Introduction
</h2>
<p>
  I'm a senior in high school. My main interests are Star Wars, astronomy, and anthropology. I plan on majoring in anthropology at UMass Amherst.

  In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing video games. I'm currently reading "This Book is Full of Spiders" by David Wong. My current favorite vodeo games are Animal Crossing, and the phone version of The Sims.
