  Introduction
</h2>
<p>
  I'm a senior in high school. My main interests are Star Wars, astronomy, and anthropology. I plan on majoring in anthropology at UMass Amherst.

  In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing video games. I'm currently reading "This Book is Full of Spiders" by David Wong. I also really like reading about jellyfish (which aren't technically fish).
