  Introduction
</h2>
<div class = "primary-content col">
  I'm a senior in high school. My main interests are Star Wars, astronomy, and anthropology. I plan on majoring in anthropology at UMass Amherst.
  I really like reading about jellyfish (which aren't technically fish).

  In my free time I enjoy reading and playing with my dog. I'm currently reading "The Remains of the Day" for English class and I recently finished "This Book is Full of Spiders."
